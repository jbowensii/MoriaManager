Lord of the Rings Return to Moria Game Manager

Hi everyone, I have just finished releasing one of my Moria Manager applications.  

This application:
- Handles multiple game installs (Steam, Epic, and Custom)
- Backup and Restore Worlds and Characters while keeping them organized
- Mark a world bad and restore a .BAK file 
- Installs and removes mods (with drag and drop zip functionality)
- Manages Server connection data and allows quick cut and paste into the RTM Game interface
- Trade manager to track what traders want what items

Watch what it can do here... Non-public BETA video demonstration here: https://youtu.be/1Vm_W0fmGQ0 
All issues shown in the video have been resolved and tested, please enter bugs on github.
